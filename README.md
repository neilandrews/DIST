DIST (Digital Image Steganography Tool)
=======

DIST is a  WinForm application that provides functionality to embedd large amounts of (binary) data into digital 
images using a selection of steganography algorithms. Functionality is also included to 'de-code' existing 
steg-images and extract perviously embedded data.

Future functionality will see the inclusion of additional steganography algorithms, and a steganalyser, 
which will run several tests and attempt to find hidden information in a specified image.
