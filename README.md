## DIST (Digital Image Steganography Tool)


DIST is a  WinForm application that provides functionality to embedd large amounts of binary data into digital 
images using a selection of steganography algorithms. Functionality is also included decoding existing 
steg-images to extract perviously embedded data.

Future functionality will see the inclusion of additional steganography algorithms, and a steganalyser, 
which will run several tests and attempt to find hidden information in a specified image.

This project is unfininshed, and on hold.  I may return back to it some day.
